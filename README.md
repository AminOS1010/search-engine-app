# DevSecOps Workshops: Git & Github

This is a brief introduction to Git and Github, followed by a workshop. For the workshop material, visit <a href="https://github.com/mdnfiras/devsecops-git-github" target="_blank">github.com/mdnfiras/devsecops-git-github</a>.

## What is Git?

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

## What is Github?

Github is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

## Start using Git & Github

In this workshop, we're going to pretend we're building a product in C++: our awesome search engine. First, ask to be added as a collaborator in this repo. Then clone the repo, create and switch to a new development branch `develop-your_name` and push it. When solving any of the following issues, start from your development branch, create and switch to a new branch `optimizing search` or `optimizing pipeline` depending on the issue you're working on, then trigger a pull request (PR). The workflow we described here is a simple scenario from the famous Gitflow workflow. Refer to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank">www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow</a> for more information.

In this workshop, you'll be be basically changing code and pushing to new branches, and triggering pull requests to your `develop-your_name` branch.

### First issue

You're the developer. The product you're developing (the search engine) currently do not satisfy the requirements as it becomes very slow with a large amount of input. Refer to the issue at <a href="https://github.com/mdnfiras/devsecops-github-actions/issues/1" target="_blank">github.com/mdnfiras/devsecops-github-actions/issues/1</a> for more details. If you have any question regarding this task, you can leave a comment in that same issue.

### Second issue

You're a DevOps engineer. The CI pipeline you've set up is slow. refer to the issue at <a href="https://github.com/mdnfiras/devsecops-github-actions/issues/3" target="_blank">github.com/mdnfiras/devsecops-github-actions/issues/3</a> for more details. If you have any question regarding this task, you can leave a comment in that same issue.
